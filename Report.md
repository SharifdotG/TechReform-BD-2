### 1. Motivation

The primary motivation behind "TechReform BD 2" is to revolutionize how PC components are purchased in Bangladesh, ensuring users get fair prices and reliable after-sales service. The project aims to create a transparent and user-friendly online platform where technology enthusiasts can buy components at or near Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). This is achieved by fundamentally altering the traditional supply chain, moving from an often opaque "importer -> multiple intermediaries -> supplier -> user" model to a more direct "manufacturer -> authorized local supplier/TechReform BD -> user" model.

Existing systems and local market practices often involve multiple layers of intermediaries, leading to inflated prices, limited availability of niche products, and challenges in accessing timely and authentic warranty or RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) services directly from manufacturers. "TechReform BD 2" intends to address these critical pain points.

Two examples of similar or existing systems are:

1. **PCPartPicker (Global):**

    - **Description:** PCPartPicker is a widely recognized platform that allows users to select individual computer components and checks for compatibility issues. It provides price comparisons from various retailers and enables users to share their builds.
    - **Gaps/Improvements addressed by TechReform BD 2:** While PCPartPicker is excellent for compatibility checking and price aggregation from various retailers (often reflecting existing market prices), it doesn't inherently address the issue of inflated prices due to local supply chain inefficiencies or lack of direct manufacturer access. "TechReform BD 2" aims to go a step further by actively working to establish a supply channel that offers components closer to MSRP. It will provide a localized experience for Bangladesh, including local payment gateways and support, with a core focus on fair pricing and direct-from-manufacturer warranty benefits. The integrated blog and e-commerce backend will support this by educating users about fair pricing and warranty processes.

2. **Star Tech (Bangladesh):**
    - **Description:** Star Tech is a prominent e-commerce platform and retailer in Bangladesh that sells a wide range of tech products, including computer components, laptops, and accessories. They have physical stores and an online presence.
    - **Gaps/Improvements addressed by TechReform BD 2:** While established retailers like Star Tech provide accessibility to products, pricing can still be influenced by traditional multi-layered distribution networks. "TechReform BD 2" aims to differentiate itself by focusing on the "manufacturer -> supplier -> user" model to offer more competitive pricing, potentially closer to MSRP. Furthermore, by fostering closer ties with manufacturers or their primary authorized distributors, the project aims to ensure users receive the best possible after-market service, RMA, and warranty support, which can sometimes be a complex process with traditional retail channels. The platform's PC building tools and community features will also empower users with knowledge about fair value and service expectations.

"TechReform BD 2" seeks to fill these gaps by offering a tailored, all-in-one solution that prioritizes fair pricing and reliable after-sales support for the Bangladeshi tech community. By streamlining the supply chain and fostering direct or near-direct relationships with manufacturers, the project aims to empower users with access to components at or near MSRP, along with the assurance of authentic warranty and RMA services. This, combined with e-commerce, a sophisticated PC builder, product comparison tools, and a community blog, will create a truly reformed tech purchasing experience.

### 2. Problem Statement

The core problem "TechReform BD 2" aims to solve is the prevalence of inflated pricing for PC components and the often cumbersome after-sales service experience faced by technology consumers and PC enthusiasts in Bangladesh. The traditional "importer -> multiple intermediaries -> supplier -> user" model frequently results in prices significantly above the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). This lack of price transparency and direct access to manufacturer-backed support creates several challenges:

- **Inflated Component Prices:** Consumers often pay a premium for PC components due to multiple layers in the supply chain, each adding their margin. This makes building or upgrading PCs more expensive than it needs to be, limiting accessibility.
- **Difficulty in Accessing Fair Deals:** It is challenging for users to ascertain fair market prices and find components at or near MSRP, leading to a sense of uncertainty and potential overpayment.
- **Complex and Unreliable After-Sales Service/RMA:** Navigating warranty claims and RMA processes can be difficult when dealing with multiple intermediaries. Users may face delays, unclear procedures, or even denial of legitimate claims, diminishing the value of their purchases and trust in brands.
- **Limited Availability of Authentic Products with Full Warranty:** The convoluted supply chain can sometimes lead to a grey market where product authenticity and the validity of manufacturer warranties are questionable.
- **Information Asymmetry:** Users may lack clear information about official warranty terms and procedures directly from manufacturers, relying instead on retailer-specific policies which might not always align.
- **Complexity of Custom PC Building:** While a secondary issue, building a custom PC is made more daunting when coupled with the uncertainty of fair pricing and reliable component sourcing.

"TechReform BD 2" addresses these issues by creating an integrated web application that champions a "manufacturer -> authorized local supplier/TechReform BD -> user" model. This platform will provide a comprehensive product catalog with transparent pricing aiming for MSRP, an intuitive PC builder, robust product comparison, secure user authentication, and streamlined access to manufacturer-backed warranty and RMA information and processes. The goal is to ensure users get the right deal directly and the best possible after-market service.

**Technical Requirement:**

- **Chosen Design Process Model:**

  - **Model:** **Agile (specifically Scrum or Kanban)** is inferred or highly recommended for a project like "TechReform BD 2".
  - **Justification:**
    - **Iterative Development:** Web applications of this nature benefit from iterative development, allowing for features to be developed, tested, and released in cycles. This helps in gathering early feedback and adapting to changing requirements.
    - **Flexibility:** The tech market and user preferences can evolve. Agile allows for flexibility in accommodating new features or modifications throughout the development lifecycle.
    - **Collaboration:** Agile promotes close collaboration between developers, and potentially stakeholders (if user feedback is actively sought). Given the team structure (multiple members), Agile methodologies facilitate better coordination.
    - **Rapid Prototyping:** Features like the PC builder or product comparison can be complex. Agile allows for building core functionality first and then incrementally adding enhancements.
    - **Continuous Improvement:** Regular reviews and retrospectives in Agile help in refining the development process and the product itself.

- **Design Pattern(s) Used:**

  - **Model-View-Template (MVT):**

    - **Explanation:** Since the project uses Django (as indicated by manage.py, `settings.py` in TechReform, and Django in requirements.txt), it inherently follows the MVT architectural pattern.
      - **Model:** Represents the data structure and interacts with the database. In "TechReform BD 2", models would define products, users, orders, blog posts, PC builds, etc. (evident in `models.py` files within each app).
      - **View:** Handles the request-response logic. It fetches data from models, processes it, and selects an appropriate template to render. In Django, views are Python functions or classes that take a web request and return a web response (evident in `views.py` files).
      - **Template:** Defines the presentation layer – how the data is displayed to the user. Django templates are typically HTML files with special syntax to display dynamic data (evident in the templates directory).
    - **Justification:** MVT promotes separation of concerns, making the codebase more organized, maintainable, and scalable. It allows front-end and back-end development to occur more independently.
  - **Other Verified Design Patterns (from AuthApp analysis):**

    **Decorator Pattern:**
    - **Implementation:** Custom authentication decorators (`@admin_required`, `@staff_required`, `@role_required`)
    - **Location:** `AuthApp/decorators.py`
    - **Purpose:** Role-based access control with composable permission checking
    - **Example:** `@role_required(['admin', 'staff'])` wraps view functions with authorization logic

    **Template Method Pattern:**
    - **Implementation:** Custom form classes extending Django's base forms
    - **Location:** `AuthApp/forms.py` (`CustomUserCreationForm`, `CustomAuthenticationForm`)
    - **Purpose:** Defines form processing skeleton while allowing customization of specific steps
    - **Example:** `CustomUserCreationForm.save()` extends base save method with profile creation

    **Observer Pattern:**
    - **Implementation:** Django signals for automatic profile management
    - **Location:** `AuthApp/models.py` (`@receiver` decorators)
    - **Purpose:** Automatic UserProfile creation and role management when User objects are created/updated
    - **Example:** `create_or_update_user_profile` signal automatically creates profiles for new users

    **Strategy Pattern:**
    - **Implementation:** Role-based permission checking in UserProfile model
    - **Location:** `AuthApp/models.py` (UserProfile methods: `is_admin()`, `is_staff()`, etc.)
    - **Purpose:** Different permission strategies based on user roles
    - **Example:** Different access levels for admin, staff, content_manager, blogger, user roles

    **Factory Pattern:**
    - **Implementation:** Automatic ticket ID generation and default category creation
    - **Location:** `AuthApp/models.py` (`SupportTicket.save()`, signal for default categories)
    - **Purpose:** Standardized creation of complex objects with proper initialization
    - **Example:** Ticket IDs generated as "TR{8-char-UUID}" format with automatic timestamps

    **State Pattern:**
    - **Implementation:** Support ticket status management with behavior changes
    - **Location:** `AuthApp/models.py` (`SupportTicket` model)
    - **Purpose:** Ticket behavior changes based on status (open, in_progress, resolved, closed)
    - **Example:** `is_overdue` property calculates differently based on current status

    **Command Pattern:**
    - **Implementation:** Support ticket response system with different action types
    - **Location:** `AuthApp/models.py` (`SupportResponse` model)
    - **Purpose:** Encapsulates different types of ticket actions (customer response, staff response, internal note)
    - **Example:** Responses can be customer messages, staff replies, or internal notes with different access levels

**Project Development Resources:**

The TechReform BD project utilizes a comprehensive technology stack following modern web development best practices. Based on the detailed codebase analysis, the project development resources include:

### 1. **Models & Database Architecture**

**Database Design Pattern:** Repository Pattern with Django ORM

```python
# BaseProduct Abstract Model - Inheritance Pattern
class BaseProduct(models.Model):
    """Abstract base model implementing common product attributes."""
    id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    brand = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    model = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    discount_price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=True, blank=True)
    stock = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)
    is_available = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

    class Meta:
        abstract = True

    @property
    def discount_percentage(self):
        """Calculate discount percentage if discount price exists."""
        if self.discount_price and self.discount_price < self.price:
            return round(((self.price - self.discount_price) / self.price) * 100, 2)
        return 0

# Concrete Product Models - Specialization Pattern
class CPU(BaseProduct):
    """CPU model with specific technical specifications."""
    socket = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    cores = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    threads = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    base_clock = models.DecimalField(max_digits=4, decimal_places=2)
    boost_clock = models.DecimalField(max_digits=4, decimal_places=2)
    architecture = models.CharField(max_length=50)

    class Meta:
        verbose_name = "CPU"
        verbose_name_plural = "CPUs"
```

**Key Model Categories:**

- **User Management Models:** UserProfile with role-based access control (Customer, Staff, Content Manager, Blogger, Admin)
- **Product Catalog Models:** 13+ specialized product models (CPU, GPU, RAM, Motherboard, etc.) inheriting from BaseProduct
- **E-commerce Models:** Cart, CartItem, Order, OrderItem, ShippingAddress with UUID primary keys
- **Content Models:** BlogPost, Comment, Category with rich text support via CKEditor
- **Advanced Feature Models:** PCBuilder, CompareProduct, WishList, SupportTicket

### 2. **Design Patterns Implementation**

**Model-View-Template (MVT) Pattern:**

```python
# views.py - Business Logic Layer
from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404
from django.db.models import Q
from .models import CPU, GPU, Motherboard

def search_products(request):
    """Advanced product search with filtering capabilities."""
    query = request.GET.get('q', '')
    category = request.GET.get('category', '')
    min_price = request.GET.get('min_price')
    max_price = request.GET.get('max_price')
    brand = request.GET.get('brand')

    # Factory Pattern for dynamic model selection
    model_mapping = {
        'cpu': CPU,
        'gpu': GPU,
        'motherboard': Motherboard,
        # ... other models
    }

    if category and category in model_mapping:
        ProductModel = model_mapping[category]
        products = ProductModel.objects.filter(is_available=True)

        # Chain of Responsibility Pattern for filters
        if query:
            products = products.filter(
                Q(name__icontains=query) |
                Q(brand__icontains=query) |
                Q(model__icontains=query)
            )

        if min_price:
            products = products.filter(price__gte=min_price)

        if max_price:
            products = products.filter(price__lte=max_price)

        if brand:
            products = products.filter(brand__iexact=brand)

    return render(request, 'product/search_results.html', {
        'products': products,
        'query': query,
        'category': category
    })
```

**Decorator Pattern for Access Control:**

```python
# decorators.py - Authorization Wrapper Pattern
from functools import wraps
from django.shortcuts import redirect
from django.contrib import messages

def role_required(roles):
    """Decorator implementing role-based access control."""
    def decorator(view_func):
        @wraps(view_func)
        def wrapper(request, *args, **kwargs):
            if not request.user.is_authenticated:
                messages.error(request, 'Authentication required.')
                return redirect('auth:login')

            try:
                user_profile = request.user.userprofile
                if user_profile.role not in roles and not request.user.is_superuser:
                    messages.error(request, 'Access denied. Insufficient permissions.')
                    return redirect('product:index')
            except UserProfile.DoesNotExist:
                messages.error(request, 'User profile not found.')
                return redirect('auth:profile_setup')

            return view_func(request, *args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

# Usage in views
@role_required(['admin', 'staff'])
def admin_product_dashboard(request):
    """Administrative dashboard for product management."""
    pass
```

**Factory Pattern for Dynamic Model Handling:**

```python
# Product factory for dynamic component creation
class ProductFactory:
    """Factory pattern for creating product instances."""

    @staticmethod
    def create_product(category, **kwargs):
        """Create product instance based on category."""
        product_models = {
            'cpu': CPU,
            'gpu': GPU,
            'motherboard': Motherboard,
            'ram': RAM,
            'ssd': SSD,
            'hdd': HDD,
            'power_supply': PowerSupply,
            'casing': Casing,
            'cooler': Cooler,
            'monitor': Monitor,
            'keyboard': Keyboard,
            'mouse': Mouse,
            'headphone': Headphone,
        }

        if category not in product_models:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid product category: {category}")

        ProductModel = product_models[category]
        return ProductModel.objects.create(**kwargs)
```

### 3. **Framework & Technology Stack**

**Template System Example:**

```django-html
<!-- base.html - Template Inheritance Pattern -->
{% load static tailwind_tags %}
{% load humanize %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" data-theme="light">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>{% block title %}TechReform BD{% endblock %}</title>

    <!-- Tailwind CSS Integration -->
    {% tailwind_css %}

    <!-- Custom Styling -->
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: "Sora", sans-serif;
            overflow-x: hidden;
        }
        .bg-blur-element {
            position: absolute;
            border-radius: 100%;
            filter: blur(70px);
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Dynamic Navigation -->
    <nav class="bg-white shadow-lg">
        {% include 'components/navbar.html' %}
    </nav>

    <!-- Main Content -->
    <main>
        {% block content %}{% endblock %}
    </main>

    <!-- Footer -->
    {% include 'components/footer.html' %}

    <!-- JavaScript -->
    <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>
    {% block extra_scripts %}{% endblock %}
</body>
</html>
```

### 4. **API Design & Architecture**

**RESTful URL Routing Pattern:**

```python
# urls.py - Hierarchical URL Design
from django.urls import path, include

# Main project URLs
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('ProductsApp.urls')),           # Product catalog
    path('auth/', include('AuthApp.urls')),          # Authentication
    path('cart/', include('CartApp.urls')),          # Shopping cart
    path('pc-builder/', include('PCBuilderApp.urls')), # PC configuration
    path('compare/', include('CompareApp.urls')),     # Product comparison
    path('wishlist/', include('WishlistApp.urls')),  # User wishlists
    path('blog/', include('BlogApp.urls')),          # Content management
    path('ckeditor/', include('ckeditor_uploader.urls')), # File uploads
]

# App-specific URL patterns (ProductsApp/urls.py)
app_name = 'product'
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
    path('search/', views.search_products, name='search'),
    path('category/<str:category>/', views.category_list, name='category_list'),
    path('product/<uuid:product_id>/', views.product_detail, name='product_detail'),
    path('ajax/suggestions/', views.get_product_suggestions, name='ajax_suggestions'),
]
```

**AJAX Integration for Dynamic Content:**

```javascript
// Real-time search suggestions
document.getElementById('search-input').addEventListener('input', function() {
    const query = this.value;
    if (query.length > 2) {
        fetch(`/ajax/suggestions/?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`)
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => {
                displaySuggestions(data.suggestions);
            })
            .catch(error => console.error('Search error:', error));
    }
});

// Dynamic cart updates
function addToCart(productId, quantity = 1) {
    fetch('/cart/add/', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'X-CSRFToken': getCookie('csrftoken'),
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            product_id: productId,
            quantity: quantity
        })
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        if (data.success) {
            updateCartCount(data.cart_count);
            showNotification('Product added to cart', 'success');
        }
    });
}
```

### 5. **Database & Data Management**

**Database Configuration:**

- **Development:** SQLite (db.sqlite3)
- **Production:** PostgreSQL (via psycopg2-binary)
- **Caching:** Redis integration for session management
- **Background Tasks:** Celery for asynchronous processing

**Media & Static File Handling:**

```python
# settings.py - File Management Configuration
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    BASE_DIR / 'static',
    BASE_DIR / 'theme' / 'static',
]

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'

# Static file storage for production
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'
```

### 6. **Testing Framework & Quality Assurance**

**Multi-Level Testing Strategy:**

**Unit Testing with Django TestCase:**

```python
# AuthApp/tests.py
from django.test import TestCase, Client
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from .models import UserProfile

class UserProfileTestCase(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.user = User.objects.create_user(
            username='testuser',
            email='test@example.com',
            password='testpass123'
        )

    def test_profile_creation(self):
        """Test automatic profile creation via signals."""
        self.assertTrue(hasattr(self.user, 'userprofile'))
        self.assertEqual(self.user.userprofile.role, 'customer')

    def test_role_permissions(self):
        """Test role-based access control."""
        profile = self.user.userprofile
        profile.role = 'admin'
        profile.save()
        self.assertTrue(profile.is_admin())
```

**End-to-End Testing with Selenium:**

```python
# tests/SignUp_Login.py
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
import pytest

class TestSignUpLogin:
    def setup_method(self):
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        self.wait = WebDriverWait(self.driver, 10)

    def teardown_method(self):
        self.driver.quit()

    @pytest.mark.parametrize("username,email,password", [
        ("validuser", "valid@email.com", "ValidPass123!"),
        ("testuser2", "test2@email.com", "SecurePass456@"),
    ])
    def test_user_registration(self, username, email, password):
        """Test user registration with valid credentials."""
        self.driver.get("http://localhost:8000/auth/register/")

        # Fill registration form
        self.driver.find_element(By.NAME, "username").send_keys(username)
        self.driver.find_element(By.NAME, "email").send_keys(email)
        self.driver.find_element(By.NAME, "password1").send_keys(password)
        self.driver.find_element(By.NAME, "password2").send_keys(password)

        # Submit form
        self.driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//button[@type='submit']").click()

        # Verify successful registration
        success_message = self.wait.until(
            EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "alert-success"))
        )
        assert "Registration successful" in success_message.text
```

**Results of Testing Scripts:**

The report should include summaries or snippets of the output from testing scripts. The project structure indicates the presence of test files (test_support_system.py, login_test.py, register_test.py, and `tests.py` in various apps).

- **Unit Test Results:**

  - **Description:** Show the output from running Django's test runner (e.g., `python manage.py test`). This output typically includes the number of tests run, number of passes, number of failures, and any errors encountered.
  - **Example Snippet (Conceptual):**

            ```
            Found 85 test(s).
            Creating test database for alias 'default'...
            System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
            .....................................................................................
            ----------------------------------------------------------------------
            Ran 85 tests in 10.321s

            OK
            Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
            ```

  - Or, if there were failures:

            ```
            FAIL: test_login_with_invalid_credentials (AuthApp.tests.LoginTest)
            ----------------------------------------------------------------------
            Traceback (most recent call last):
              File "d:\Programming\VSCode\TechReform-BD\AuthApp\login_test.py", line 25, in test_login_with_invalid_credentials
                self.assertContains(response, "Invalid credentials")
            AssertionError: False is not true : Response did not contain "Invalid credentials"
            ...
            Ran 85 tests in 12.500s

            FAILED (failures=1)
            ```

- **Integration Test Results (if applicable):**
  - **Description:** If specific integration tests are written (e.g., testing the flow from adding to cart to checkout), their success/failure status should be reported. This might involve more descriptive logging or custom reports.
- **Code Coverage Reports:**

  - **Description:** Include a summary from a code coverage tool (e.g., `coverage.py`). This shows what percentage of the codebase is covered by tests.
  - **Example Snippet (Conceptual, from `coverage report`):**

            ```
            Name                               Stmts   Miss  Cover
